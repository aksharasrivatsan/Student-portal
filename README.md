## React + Vite

This project was bootstrapped using **React + Vite** (default setup provided by Vite).

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with **HMR** and some **ESLint rules**.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- `@vitejs/plugin-react` uses **Babel** (or **oxc** when used in rolldown-vite) for Fast Refresh  
- `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` uses **SWC** for Fast Refresh  

### React Compiler

The React Compiler is **not enabled** in this template because of its impact on **development and build performance**.  
To add it, refer to the official React Compiler documentation.

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

If you are developing a **production application**, we recommend using **TypeScript** with **type-aware lint rules** enabled.

Check out the **TypeScript template** for information on how to integrate **TypeScript** and **typescript-eslint** in your project.
